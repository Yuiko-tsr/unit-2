## Find a computer made out of anything else but transistors
**ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)**
* It was the result of a U.S. government-funded project during World War II to build an electronic computer that could be programmed. 
* The project was based out of the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Engineering. 
* The design team included engineer J. Presper Eckert Jr. and physicist John Mauchly under the leadership of Herman Goldstine. 
* It was programmed to compute the values of artillery range tables. Plugboards were used to relay instructions to the machine, which could then do the computations at high speed.
* It was a huge machine, taking up a 1,500-square-foot room at the Moore School. The machine was made up of 40 panels arranged in a U-shape along three of the room's walls. 
* Along with the panels, which were each 8 feet high, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet deep, the machine included 70,000 resistors, 17,000 vacuum tubes, 10,000 capacitors, 1,500 relays, and 6,000 switches. 
* The machine was completed in February 1946 at a total cost of about $400,000. Its purpose was to help the United States win World War II, but the war ended before the machine was finished. Instead, its first job was doing calculations to help with building hydrogen bombs.

## Who invented the transistor?
The transistor was successfully demonstrated on December 23, 1947 at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. 
The three individuals credited with the invention of the transistor were **William Shockley**, **John Bardeen** and **Walter Brattain**.
